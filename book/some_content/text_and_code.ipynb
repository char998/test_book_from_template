In structural engineering, when assessing the health of a structure, we have to take into account the loads imposed as well as the decay of the building materials. In climate science, when trying to study the effect of climate change in agricultural production we have to consider the impact of temperature change, soil moisture and precipitation, amongst others, in vegetation. \n",
